## Face Analysis in a Video Call through Image Processing
The aim is to predict the emotions, age of individuals using image data sets. An growing number of applications, especially after the increase in social networks and social media, are being concerned with automatic emotion, age classification. Age and gender, emotions are the two most fundamental facial qualities in social interaction. In smart applications, such as access control, human computer interaction, enforcement, marketing intelligence and visual supervision, etc, it is important to make age evaluations using one facial image. Machine learning: supervised learning, image recognition, and deep learning: a ground breaking neural network and profound learning are the most common technologies used in this project. Supervised learning can be described as a machine learning technique in which the input is mapped to the output using input-output pair training data.
